    /**
     * The MidiScheduler provides the interface to the MIDI system (be it
     * a software or hardware driver). On top of this it implements a timed
     * stream for reception and transmission of MidiEvents.
     *
     * This is the TSE3 platform independant interface to the underlying
     * MIDI hardware. (In fact, it might not even be hardware, this could
     * be the interface to a software synth).
     *
     * To create a MidiScheduler you will need to use an object derived from
     * this class. The @ref MidiSchedulerFactory classes help you to create
     * this.
     *
     * @sect Ports
     *
     * The interface provides a number of MIDI "ports" (which may be added to
     * or removed at run time, depending on the type of system TSE3 is running
     * on).
     *
     * These ports are referenced by a unique number. You read or write data
     * from/to ports via the @ref MidiEvent data type. The MidiEvent has a
     * "port" number field which identifies which port the command is destined
     * for.
     *
     * As well as having numbers, the API allows you read a port name. You
     * can also set a "preferred" name for each port. This allows the user to
     * give a more useful name to the port (perhaps for use in a GUI).
     *
     * Port numbers are not necessarily contiguous and can have any value -
     * this will depend on the phyiscal MIDI device in use. In order to find
     * out what port numbers are in use use the following APIs:
     *   @li @ref MidiScheduler::numPorts()
     *   @li @ref MidiScheduler::portNumbers()
     *
     * Note that there are two reserved special port numbers:
     *   @li @ref MidiCommand::NoPort   - Commands addressed here disappear
     *   @li @ref MidiCommand::AllPorts - Commands addressed here go to every
     *                                    port in the system.
     *
     * @sect Time
     *
     * As well as managing the MIDI ports, the MidiScheduler looks after a
     * clock that it used to schedule delivery of these events. The API
     * allows you to start/stop/move the time line, as well as set the clock's
     * tempo.
     *
     * The MidiScheduler can notify back to its clients if the timestream has
     * moved, or been started/stopped by a device on the MIDI connection.
     *
     * If the timestream is 'stopped' the MidiScheduler class will still
     * remember a 'current' clock value, informally known as the 'resting
     * clock'. When you ask for the time (see @ref MidiScheduler::clock)
     * you will be given this 'resting clock'.
     *
     * @sect Remote control
     *
     * Additionally, the MidiScheduler provides a MIDI remote control facility,
     * where certain MIDI notes can trigger transport start/stop.
     *
     * The keys that are set to be "remote controls" will not be passed up
     * through the API in a @ref MidiEvent if remote control is enabled.
     *
     * If you switch this facility on, you have to bear in mind that the only
     * time the MidiScheduler gets a chance to investigate the input note
     * stream is as you consume events from it. (For simplicity it doesn't
     * have a clever background thread implementation).
     *
     * Therefore, read events from the MidiScheduler in a timely manner.
     *
     * @sect That's all folks
     *
     * The MidiScheduler class does not incorporate a lot of other fancy
     * utilities, like channel/port remapping, for example. Higher level TSE3
     * components do this, for example the @ref MidiMapper class. The
     * @ref Transport class ties this all together.
     *
     * @sect Implementing a MidiScheduler
     *
     * If you are porting TSE3 to another platform, you will need to
     * implement this MidiScheduler interface. It uses the template method
     * pattern (GoF book) - you have to implement a few member functions
     * and the base MidiScheduler class looks after most of the logic.
     *
     * These template methods are in the protected section near the end and
     * are all pretty easy to understand.
