TSE3 Library README
===================

Welcome to the TSE3 library, a sophisticated sequencer engine.

The TSE3 homepage is http://TSE3.sourceforge.net.

TSE3 documentation is provided in HTML format in the "doc" directory. To obtain
a fully formatted version of this documentation you need to build the TSE3
library. However, you can still read the files in a browser or text editor
prior to building (look at "doc/src/*.html.in"). The "doc/README" file has more
information.

Alternatively, you can view the documentation online at the TSE3 homepage.

In particular, please read "doc/Feedback.html" before sending any bug reports.

Also, you may like to read "doc/Build.html" for more information on building the
library.
