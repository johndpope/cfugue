<h2><a name="How_It_Works">How It Works</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><i>Play By Ear</i> application helps you improve your music perception skills in a fun yet challenging way. Working with the application is simple and straight forward. It poses you questions (music notes) and you have to identify them correctly. During this Question-Answer(QA) process, application will analyze your 
    Effeciency and Accuracy for each response.</p>
    <p align="justify">Accuracy measures how much correctly you are answering the 
        questions. When a question is played as a series of music notes to you, you enter your answers using the Piano control provided on the application window. 
        When the answer is wrong, you will be given a chance to retry another answer. 
        This way, you can keep retrying a question till you get the correct answer. 
        However, with each retry, your Accuracy ratings will go down.</p>
    <p align="justify">Efficiency measures how much unnecessary work you are avoiding to answering each question. 
        When a question is played as a series of music notes to you, you enter your answers using the Piano control provided on the application window. 
        You can replay a question as many times as you want and/or change your answer as 
        many times as you want before submitting it for verification. However, with each 
        replay of the question/answer your Efficiency ratings will go down.</p>
<p align="justify">Your goal, hence, is simple. Improve your Accuracy and Efficiency ratings over time, 
    by answering correctly, with as less retries as possible, and with as 
    little replays as possible. In other words, one who listens the questions 
    carefully and remembers the notes correctly and avoids replaying the question/answer will get higher Efficiency ratings. 
    And, one who answers the 
    question correctly with as less retries as possible gets higher Accurary ratings. 
    </p>
<p align="justify">Remember that when you enter a wrong answer, you have the option of skipping to the 
    next question (instead of retrying the same one). However, choosing to skip a question does not 
    save your Accuracy ratings either. You would still be penalized (though a little 
    bit less than what it would be if you were to enter all wrong answers till you 
    run out of answers).     </p>
<p align="justify">Note that it is important to have both the Accuracy and 
    Efficiency ratings high. One who excels in one, but zeroes in on the other is 
    not an expert and needs to work on improving the other too. No other learning / 
    teaching technique helps you improve these two areas so elegangly as this 
    application does to the students.</p>
<p align="justify"> This application will help you improve your Accuracy and Efficiency 
    ratings if you keep practicing the QA sessions consistently. You can play the QA Sessions at any of the four 
    below mentioned levels. Each has specific purpose targetted to improve specific area of music note perception.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p align="justify">
            Single Note - Middle Octave Level: This is the basic beginner level. The 
            question would be made of a single note randomly picked from the 12 notes of the 
            middle octave. You need to correctly identify the questioned note./p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="justify">
            Single Note - Multiple Octaves Level: This is same as the above, with the 
            exception the note will be picked randoly from any of the 1 to 5 octaves. Here 
            you have more choice of notes, and so little bit difficult than the previous 
            level. But if you have command over all the notes in all the five octaves, you 
            should be able to cross this level easily</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="justify">
            Multiple Notes Level: Unlike the previous two levels, where only single note is 
            played as part of question, here a series of notes (picked randomly from all the 
            five octaves) are played and you have to reproduce them in the exact same order 
            to answer correctly. This level improves your note perceptions skill as well as 
            rememberance and replay skills. This is quite important if you want to start 
            composing your own music.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="justify">
            Scale/Raga Level: This is the final level. Currently this level is not supported 
            by this application. Typically in this level you would be played a random tune 
            and you have to identify its characteristics such as its Scale (Raga) etc.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Key_Bindings">Key Bindings</a></h2>
<p align="justify">For Piano control provided on the application window, Keyboard keys are mapped to individual Notes (Swaras) in an octave. The mapping is done similar to the 
    real world Piano keys (alternate black &amp; white forming up &amp; down series), starting with 
    key Z and ending at 
    key M. 
</p>
<p>The mapping is as below:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr align="center"><td>Keyboard Key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td>Western Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td>Carnatic Swara</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>Z</td><td>C</td><td>S</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>S</td><td>C#</td><td>R1</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>X</td><td>D</td><td>R2</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>D</td><td>D#</td><td>G2</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>C</td><td>E</td><td>G3</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>V</td><td>F</td><td>M1</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>G</td><td>F#</td><td>M2</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>B</td><td>G</td><td>P</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>H</td><td>G#</td><td>D1</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>N</td><td>A</td><td>D2</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>J</td><td>A#</td><td>N2</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>M</td><td>B</td><td>N3</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The pattern extends to next keys: , L . ; etc..</p>
<p align="justify">Though the Piano control on the dialog has 5 Octaves (just like a 
    typical real world instrument does), the limited number of keys on the Keyboard, however, does not allow us to play all octaves at the same time the way we do with real instruments. So we restrict the keys to be bound to only one 'active' octave at any time; 
    When we need to change the octave, we simply shift the 'active' octave. This is not as elegant as working with the real instrument. But this works.</p>
<p align="justify"> Use the Function Keys (F1 .. F5) to select the current &#39;active&#39; Octave. Or, use the TAB key to shift to next heigher octave, and the BACKSPACE key to shift to next lower octave.
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr align="center"><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Keyboard Key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Functionality&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr align="center"><td>F1</td><td>select Octave 1</td></tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td>
            F2</td><td>select Octave 2</td>
    </tr>

    <tr align="center">
        <td>
            F3</td><td>select Octave 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center">
        <td>
            F4</td><td>select Octave 4</td>
    </tr>

    <tr align="center">
        <td>
            F5</td><td>select Octave 5</td>
    </tr>

    <tr align="center">
        <td>
            TAB</td><td>one Octave UP</td>
    </tr>

    <tr align="center">
        <td>Shift TAB <br />or<br />
             BACKSPACE</td><td>one Octave DOWN</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p align="justify">By default, when the application starts for the first time, 
    Octave 3 will be set as the current &#39;active&#39; octave. You change it to other 
    octaves using the above specified keys, and the application will remember your 
    preference, even if you close it and open it again. </p>
